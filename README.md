# Intro :dog:

Are you tired of using the same old dating apps and websites that seem to only cater to humans?

Well, it's time to switch things up and try something new - **a dog dating site**!

**Woofr** is designed specifically for dogs to find their perfect match, because let's face it, dogs deserve love and companionship too.

## How It Works :dog2:

To use Woofr, you must login or create an account.

![woofr auth page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr2lhtfs8/image/upload/v1679413076/auth2_iutbnm.jpg)

Once you're in, you'll be redirected to your account details where you can edit your dog's information and profile picture, as well as view any received friendship invites. You can also view your profile page.

You can then search for other users and filter them by their location.

By clicking on View Profile, you can access the user's profile page.

Once you have a friend, you can chat with them! Just go to Chat With Your Friends.

There is a dark/light mode switch on the navigation bar! The about section has links to my Github and LinkedIn!

## Technologies Used :computer:

Woofr was built using the **MERN stack** - MongoDB, Express, React & Node.js. Styling was done with **Chakra UI**. I also used some npm packages such as Axios (for API calls to the database I created), lottie-react (for a Lottie animation that is displayed when the Find Friends page is loading), date-fns (to help with date formatting), among others.

## Future Features :crystal_ball:

- Real-time chat;
- Location by district, municipality, parish;
- Ability to find users through a map with pins (for each user);
- Accessing a friend's profile page via the Chat With Your Friends page.
